### Welcome to the Mgt Graylog Extension for Magento!

We know it cost you a lot time to delete the daily received spam through the contact and product review form.
With our magento Akismet (Automattic Kismet (Akismet for short)) extension for magento no installation of CAPCTHA is needed. 
A CAPCTHA is not very user friendly and statics have shown that it can be cracked. 
Also you must not install something difficult on your magento frontend like a CAPCTHA.
Here our "Akismet spam prevention for magento" is the best solution to kill the spam.
